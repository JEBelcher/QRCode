If you just want to create a WiFi code download and unpack the zip file then run qr1.exe  
After a successful run, you will have a file called wifi_qrcode.png in ths same folder.
Open this with any image viewer to see the QRCode.

The c# program is shown in the Program.cs file.

This is an updated version (much smaller) of a program I did about 10 years ago.
